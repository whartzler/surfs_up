## Overview

We are analyzing data from a weather data set to present to our investor W. Avy to see if the weather will impact us opening up a Surf and Icecream shop in Awahoo, Hawaii.  Then to have our data easily access we will upload the results to Flask so when we present to the board of directors they can easily review the data.  Specifically for this project we looked at June and December weather activity.

### Applications
The data was analyzed using Sqlite, python, jupyter notebooks and Flask.
