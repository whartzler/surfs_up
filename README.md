# surfs_up

## Overview

We are analyzing data from a weather data set to present to our investor W. Avy to see if the weather will impact us opening up a Surf and Icecream shop in Awahoo, Hawaii.  Then to have our data easily access we will upload the results to Flask so when we present to the board of directors they can easily review the data.  Specifically for this project we looked at June and December weather activity.

### Applications
The data was analyzed using Sqlite, python, jupyter notebooks and Flask.  

## Results
After analyzing June and December there were three main differences between the months.

1.  December's had slightly lower average tempatures as its mean was 71 degrees while June's average temps were 74.9 degreesm, 4 degrees higher.  For both months with average weather being over 70 degrees even makes the winter months nice and warm and also perfect for ice cream!

2.  June had a slightly smaller standard deviation at 3.26 while December's was at 3.75,  with June's average temp being 75 degrees the tempature doesnt fluctuate much and stays perfectly warm.  
 
3.  The total count of June was 1,700 while the count for December was 1,517.  We can conclude that in June the weather stations were more active than in December and will provide more accurate data.  Nonetheless both months had a substational amount of data to provide an accurate dataset.



## Summary
In this analysis we can conlcude Awahoo has excellent weather to open a surf shop.  In the two months we analyzed the tempatures stay warm and dont fluctuate very much being excellent weather consistantly.
